# Platform Team Project Checklist

## Introduction
This checklist is a practical guide for Platform Team members embarking on new team projects. It serves as a step-by-step guide to ensure effective collaboration and project management from start to finish.

## Why This Process?
We are implementing this process to avoid common pitfalls that can occur in team projects, such as:
- **Lack of Inclusivity and Communication:** Projects initiated without consulting the entire team can overlook diverse skills and contributions, leading to suboptimal outcomes.
- **Overlooking Expertise and Security Protocols:** Ignoring the expertise of team members, especially in critical areas like security, can result in non-compliance with necessary standards and protocols.
- **Deviation from Best Practices:** Not adhering to established best practices, like CICD processes, creates additional workload and undermines the project's quality.
- **Premature Project Completion Announcement:** Declaring a project complete without thorough team review can lead to recognition of incomplete or substandard work.
- **Post-Completion Challenges:** Discovering a project late in its development can cause frustration, especially if it fails to represent the team's capabilities and requires significant rework.

By following this checklist, we aim to ensure that every project benefits from the full range of our team's expertise, adheres to best practices, and truly reflects our collective capabilities.
